## 📦 What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Functionality
- **New Snippet:** `snippets/language-aware-carousel.liquid`
  - Detects current language (`localization.language.iso_code`)
  - Loads language-specific images from product metafields
  - Falls back to English, then default gallery if needed
  - Maintains all existing functionality (zoom, thumbnails, navigation)
  - Includes debug mode for Theme Editor

### 2. Updated Product Sections
All product section files now use the language-aware carousel:
- ✅ `sections/main-product.liquid`
- ✅ `sections/main-product-custom-box.liquid`
- ✅ `sections/main-product-test-bundle.liquid`
- ✅ `sections/main-product-protein-power.liquid`
- ✅ `sections/main-power-biscuit-custom-box.liquid`
- ✅ `sections/main-standing-order-box.liquid`

### 3. Documentation Created
- ✅ `LANGUAGE_CAROUSEL_SETUP.md` - Complete setup guide (comprehensive)
- ✅ `QUICK_START_LANGUAGE_CAROUSEL.md` - Quick reference guide
- ✅ `METAFIELD_DEFINITIONS.json` - Metafield configurations
- ✅ `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## 🎯 What You Need to Do Next

### Immediate Actions (Before Testing):

#### 1. Create Metafield Definitions in Shopify Admin

**Path:** Shopify Admin → Settings → Custom Data → Products → Add definition

Create at minimum (for your primary languages):
- `carousel.images_en` (English)
- `carousel.images_fi` (Finnish)

**Settings for each:**
- **Namespace:** `carousel`
- **Key:** `images_en` (or `images_fi`, etc.)
- **Name:** "Carousel Images (English)" (or appropriate language)
- **Type:** List of files
- **Validation:** Files must be images

See `METAFIELD_DEFINITIONS.json` for all language definitions.

#### 2. Upload Test Images

**Path:** Shopify Admin → Settings → Files

Upload at least 2-3 test images for:
- English version (e.g., `test-product_en_01.jpg`)
- Finnish version (e.g., `test-product_fi_01.jpg`)

**Tip:** Make them visually distinct (different colors/text) so you can easily verify language switching works.

#### 3. Assign Images to a Test Product

1. Go to Products → Select any product from your active templates
2. Scroll to "Metafields" section
3. Find "Carousel Images (English)"
4. Click "Add images" → Select your uploaded English test images
5. Repeat for "Carousel Images (Finnish)"
6. **Save the product**

#### 4. Test the Implementation

**Test in English:**
1. Open product page in English (e.g., `/products/power-cookie`)
2. Verify English images appear in carousel
3. Test navigation (arrows, thumbnails)
4. Test zoom functionality

**Test in Finnish:**
1. Switch language to Finnish using language picker
2. Page should reload to `/fi/products/...`
3. Verify Finnish images appear in carousel
4. Test navigation again

**Test Fallback:**
1. Create or use a product with only English images (no Finnish)
2. View in Finnish
3. Should show English images (fallback working)

**Test Default Behavior:**
1. Create or use a product with NO language metafield images
2. View in any language
3. Should show default product.media gallery

## 🔍 How to Verify It's Working

### In Theme Editor (Debug Mode):

When viewing a product in Shopify Admin's Theme Editor, you'll see a debug panel at the top showing:

```
Language Carousel Debug:
Current Language: fi
Using Language Carousel: true
Language Images Found: 3
Display Media Count: 3
```

This confirms:
- ✅ Language detected correctly
- ✅ Language carousel is active
- ✅ Correct number of images loaded

### In Browser Dev Tools:

1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Inspect the gallery element
3. Look for: `data-language-carousel="true"`
4. Look for: `data-current-lang="fi"`

## 🚀 Rollout Strategy

### Phase 1: Test (Day 1)
1. Create metafields
2. Upload test images
3. Set up 1 test product
4. Verify functionality in both languages
5. Test on mobile devices
6. Check performance (loading times)

### Phase 2: Pilot (Week 1)
1. Create real language-specific images for 2-3 key products
2. Deploy to those products
3. Monitor analytics for user interaction
4. Gather internal team feedback
5. Adjust image content/order as needed

### Phase 3: Expand (Week 2-4)
1. Roll out to remaining products gradually
2. Create images for additional languages (if needed)
3. Train content team on workflow
4. Document any issues/learnings

### Phase 4: Optimize (Ongoing)
1. Monitor which images get the most engagement
2. A/B test different image orders
3. Update images based on customer feedback
4. Expand to more languages if needed

## 🎓 Training Your Team

### For Content Managers:

Send them:
1. `QUICK_START_LANGUAGE_CAROUSEL.md` - Quick reference
2. `LANGUAGE_CAROUSEL_SETUP.md` - Detailed instructions (Section: "Content Team Workflow")

Key points to emphasize:
- Always upload images to Files first
- Use descriptive, consistent naming
- Maintain same order across languages
- Add alt text in correct language
- Save after adding images to metafields

### For Developers:

Key technical details:
- Snippet location: `snippets/language-aware-carousel.liquid`
- Metafield namespace: `carousel`
- Key pattern: `images_{language_code}`
- Fallback: Current lang → English → Default gallery
- Debug available in Theme Editor

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Don't Forget:

1. **Product cards** (homepage, collections) are NOT affected
   - They still use `product.featured_image`
   - Only **product pages** use language carousel

2. **Existing products** without metafield images will continue working normally
   - They'll show default `product.media` gallery
   - No breaking changes

3. **Theme Editor** shows debug info
   - Only visible when editing in Shopify Admin
   - Not visible to customers

4. **Language switching** requires page reload
   - This is Shopify's default behavior
   - Localization form submits and reloads page

5. **Images are CDN-cached**
   - Changes may take a few minutes to propagate
   - Clear browser cache if needed
